		<img src="images/mystery/Bhangarh.jpg" alt="adv" class="img-fluid" style="width :100%;" style="height:auto;">
		<p>Located in the Alwar region, the uninhabited town of Bhangarh is one of the eeriest places imaginable and is unanimously considered as one of India's most haunted places. It is considered to be so dangerous that even the Archaeological Survey of India has legally prohibited anyone from entering the Bhangarh Fort after dark.</p><p>The legend goes that during the 16th century, a tantric named Singhia fell in love with Ratnavati, the beautiful princess of Bhangarh. And knowing it was a hopeless match, decided to use his magic to seduce her. However, the princess uncovered his plans and sentenced him to death. Before his death, enraged by the turn of events, he cursed the palace to doom and the town to be roofless and miserable forever. Nearby locals believe that anyone who goes into the fort after dark won't make it back, so visit at your own peril.</p>

It is said that the minister of state had fallen in love with a girl from the village and had threatened to impose huge taxes upon the entire village unless they married her to him. To protect the honour of the girl, the chief of Kulhara and surrounding areas abandoned their villages and cursed the land to remain unoccupied for eternity.</p>
